# Agentic Value Stream

> **Topic:** `concept` (Enterprise-Semantics per-concept repository, ES-ADR-049 + CR-ES-049)
> **Category:** Specialization

## Definition

Specializes Value Stream. Material realization of agentic behavior within the boundary of value-stream.

Per ES-ADR-031 §4, the 5-category boundary taxonomy anchors this concept: foundational reference or specialization, agentic or autonomous independence, four-state matrix independence, AI-not-required, and cross-context materiality.

## What this repository contains

This repository is a self-contained snapshot of the canonical `Agentic Value Stream` concept, mirrored from the central Enterprise-Semantics repositories. It contains:

- The authoritative concept record (`concept.yaml` or `profile.yaml`).
- A conformance test kit with ten boundary tests: five positive conformance cases and five negative rejection cases, each anchored to the five-category taxonomy from ES-ADR-031 §4.
- Six documentation files covering the concept's definition, conformance status, target architectures, capability maturity model, assessment criteria, and measurement indicators.
- Cross-program mappings to the World Semantic Foundation, OpenDEA, and DEA Catalogs (where the concept has material relationships to those authorities).
- Visual diagrams in PlantUML format showing the concept's boundary, relationships, and cardinality.
- Reference examples demonstrating the concept's boundary assertions and conformance levels.
